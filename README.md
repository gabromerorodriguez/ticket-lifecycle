In this part of the lab, we started in the user osTicket interface.
</p>
<br />

<p>
We created the first user ticket with a Help Topic of Business Critical Outage. We added this ticket by the username of Karen and provided a brief summary of the problem.

</p>
<p>
We logged in as Jane Doe and we were able to see all tickets in her ticket dashboard that were created. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="713" alt="Capture6" src="https://github.com/gabromerorodriguez/ticket-lifecycle/assets/163021104/59ad7730-e888-4a12-8f7d-cc6e33b122d4">
</p>
<p>
We started configuring help desk tickets according to their importance and severity. In this case we had a SLA categorized as SEV-A. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="722" alt="Capture7" src="https://github.com/gabromerorodriguez/ticket-lifecycle/assets/163021104/7ee4a22c-35db-44ac-a49b-ffd7d00cc826">
</p>
<p>
In addition to the ticket from previous steps, this ticket was assigned to the System Administrators, meaning that Jane Doe collaborated with the Sys admins to resolve and close this ticket. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Next, we continued with Ken's ticket. We had a SEV-B with high priority and it was assigned to Johnny Doe. Johnny was able to resolve and close the ticket. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Next, we continued with another Karen's ticket. We had a SEV-C with low priority and a help topic of a basic inquiry. Jane Doe was able to resolve and close the ticket. At this point, all tickets were resolved and closed by our Agents. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
In conclusion, the completion of this lab using osTicket marks a significant milestone in understanding and implementing effective ticket management solutions. By configuring roles, departments, teams, agents, users, SLAs, and help topics, we have gained valuable hands-on experience in setting up and optimizing osTicket for efficient support operations. Through this practical exercise, we enhanced our ability to organize, prioritize, and resolve tickets effectively, ensuring prompt and satisfactory responses to customer inquiries and issues.
